# WearHacks

**VitaLoad** 

In this repository I tested some of the charts I used for our WearHacks project, VitaLoad. We built a dashboard to
track the location, temperature, orientation, and motion of objects in real time using data obtained from the MetaWear
https://www.mbientlab.com/.

You can see the dashboard live here: http://198.100.145.140/wh/
